# Fraud Detection Model using ML Techniques

The dataset was generated using aggregated metrics from the private dataset of a multinational mobile financial services company, and then malicious entries were injected. (TESTIMON @ NTNU, Kaggle). The dataset contains 11 columns of information for ~6 million rows of data. 

 The key columns available are:    
 

Type of transactions   
Amount transacted  
Customer ID and Recipient ID  
Old and New balance of Customer and Recipient  
Time step of the transaction  
Whether the transaction was fraudulent or not


Data Description:  


The dataset used in this analysis is a synthetic digital transaction dataset created using a simulator called PaySim. PaySim models mobile money transactions based on a real-world sample taken from one month of financial logs from a mobile money service in an African country. By anonymizing and aggregating data from the original private dataset, PaySim generates a synthetic version, adding simulated fraudulent transactions. The dataset consists of over 6 million transactions with 11 variables. One key variable, ‘isFraud,’ identifies the fraudulent transactions and serves as the target variable for our analysis. The dataset columns and their contents are detailed below.
